#Original requirement

1. Build a small RESTFUL Api that consists of 2 endpoints.



•        Build an endpoint that'll accept parameters such as a home address to extract property data from the Zillow API. Store the Zillow response data in a NoSQL or file based Database. (Bonus point for NoSQL)

•        The application should initialize with Zillow credentials. (we will use our own credentials)

•        The second endpoint should return the Zillow estimated price given a property id.
